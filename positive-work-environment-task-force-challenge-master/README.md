# Positive Work Environment Task Force for World Wide Web Consortium

## Context
World Wide Web Consortium is a global community where participants choose to work together. In that community, participants experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally. The goals of this code are to:
- Define acceptable and expected standards of behavior.
- Provide a benchmark.
- Ensure transparency in community and group management.
- Ensure an environment where people can participate without fear of harassment.
- Contribute to the identity of the organization.

## Problem Statement
1. Being a developer you are assigned with the task of creating a document formulating all the Code of Work in the [PDF](./Positive-Work-Environment-at-W3C_Code-of-Ethics-and-Professional-Conduct.pdf) to be made it available on the Web.
2. One of the intention with the document is to make sure that the document is not just human readable but also machine readable. There are machines which can crawl for the new terms added to the glossary, the new sections added to the document, the last time the document was updated. So on and so forth.

## Instructions
1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Add required code in the `index.html` file
5. First, test the solution locally by running the command `npm run test`.
6. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.
7. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.
8. Zip the solution code by selecting all the files and folders **excluding** the `node_modules` folder and give the name same as assignment name to the zipped file.
9. Upload the zipped solution for submission.
