                where I also look forward to attaining people management opportunities in my area of work. Proficient in
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with hands-on experience in frontend frameworks like React and Angular.
                Skilled in responsive web design, cross-browser compatibility, and performance optimization. Strong
                attention to detail and a problem-solving mindset, ensuring high-quality code and efficient development
                processes.
